## Features
- Send and receive text messages.
- Upload and display images.
- Integrate with Google Generative Language API for content generation.
- Modern UI using Jetpack Compose.
- Rate limiting to manage API quota.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbox.git
   cd chatbox
   ```

2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
   - Ensure you have the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.

3. **Set up API keys:**
   - Obtain an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a `local.properties` file in the root directory of your project and add your API key:
     ```properties
     GENERATIVE_LANGUAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Build and run the project:**
   - Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
   - Click on `Run` in Android Studio.

## Usage
1. **Launching the App:**
   - Open the ChatBox app on your device.

2. **Sending Messages:**
   - Type a message in the input field and press the send button to send a text message.

3. **Uploading Images:**
   - Click the photo icon to select an image from your device.
   - The selected image will be displayed in the chat.

4. **Content Generation:**
   - Enter a prompt and click the send button to generate a response using the Google Generative Language API.

## API Quota Management
The application uses the Google Generative Language API, which has usage limits. If you encounter quota errors, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Quota Usage:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and navigate to `APIs & Services > Dashboard`.

2. **Increase Quota:**
   - Request an increase in your quota via the `Quotas` section in the Google Cloud Console.

3. **Optimize API Usage:**
   - Implement caching and batch requests to minimize the number of API calls.

4. **Implement Rate Limiting:**
   - Use the provided rate limiting class to manage the rate of API requests.

### Example Rate Limiting Implementation
Here's an example of a rate limiter implemented in Kotlin:
```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.delay
import kotlinx.coroutines.sync.Mutex
import kotlinx.coroutines.sync.withLock
import kotlin.time.Duration
import kotlin.time.ExperimentalTime

class RateLimiter(private val maxRequests: Int, private val duration: Duration) {
    private val mutex = Mutex()
    private var requestCount = 0
    private var lastResetTime = System.currentTimeMillis()

    @OptIn(ExperimentalTime::class)
    suspend fun acquire() {
        mutex.withLock {
            val currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
            if (currentTime - lastResetTime > duration.inWholeMilliseconds) {
                requestCount = 0
                lastResetTime = currentTime
            }
            if (requestCount >= maxRequests) {
                delay(duration.inWholeMilliseconds - (currentTime - lastResetTime))
                requestCount = 0
                lastResetTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
            }
            requestCount++
        }
    }
}
```
